[debug]
  - two fast presses from steady remains in steady
        - one fast press works to ramp up
        - three fast presses works to go to the max level
        - four fast presses works to go to biking mode
  - stopping at the top of ramp results in being stuck at the top of ramp
        - three fast presses goes to biking mode
            => stuck in non-moving ramp mode?
        - nothing else seems to get out of the top ramp mode
        - stopping at the bottom of the ramp doesn't seem to cause any problems

  => both of these seem to point to something not being right with ramp mode

  - seems to be fixed now

  - NEW BUG: occasionally the light will just turn off on a fast press... maybe
    it's getting stuck in some corrupted mode number?

[features]
  - update manual to reflect any changes
  - Manual memory
    - for now, maybe just hardcoded, but ideally is runtime-selectable
      - perhaps just add another config menu for this?
  - add support for off-time capacitor or off-time sleep mode to distinguish
    between long and short presses
      - https://github.com/alexvanh/basic_off_time_driver/blob/master/README.md
      - the above reports that relying on SRAM decay is not a reliable
        long-term solution...
      - my current understanding is that the flipping of bits after power is
        disconnected is essentially due to noise, but I'm unsure why this
        property of the SRAM should change over time... more reading is
        required
