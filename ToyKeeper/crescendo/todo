[debug]
  - occasionally, very weird things will break
    - most likely the same issue as here:
      https://budgetlightforum.com/comment/1100942#comment-1100942
    - looks like maybe the only guaranteed fix is to implement off-time sleep
      mode, in which case the mcu will still be on and no memory integrity
      should be lost

[features]
  - update manual to reflect any changes
  - add support for off-time capacitor or off-time sleep mode to distinguish
    between long and short presses
      - https://github.com/alexvanh/basic_off_time_driver/blob/master/README.md
      - the above reports that relying on SRAM decay is not a reliable
        long-term solution...
      - my current understanding is that the flipping of bits after power is
        disconnected is essentially due to noise, but I'm unsure why this
        property of the SRAM should change over time... more reading is
        required
