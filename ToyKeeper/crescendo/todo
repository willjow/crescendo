TODO
----

  - revise manual to match code
  - ramping while in bike flasher mode
  - Manual memory
    - for now, maybe just hardcoded, but ideally is runtime-selectable
      - perhaps just add another config menu for this?
  - add support for off-time capacitor or off-time sleep mode to distinguish
    between long and short presses
      - https://github.com/alexvanh/basic_off_time_driver/blob/master/README.md
      - the above reports that relying on SRAM decay is not a reliable
        long-term solution...
      - my current understanding is that the flipping of bits after power is
        disconnected is essentially due to noise, but I'm unsure why this
        property of the SRAM should change over time... more reading is
        required
