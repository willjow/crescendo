[debug]
  - occasionaly, the ramp level will be set to 0 after a fast press
    - cannot reliably reproduce, and rarely happens to begin with
    - possibly related to low voltage protection/thermal regulation? didn't
      observe before enabling these
  - occasionally, very weird things will break
    - most likely the same issue as here:
      https://budgetlightforum.com/comment/1100942#comment-1100942
    - looks like maybe the only guaranteed fix is to implement off-time sleep
      mode, in which case the mcu will still be on and no memory integrity
      should be lost

[features]
  - add support for convoy 5A linear fet driver

  - add config variable for setting the ramp ceiling level to be different from
    the turbo level
      - should be pretty simple to just make this stop at the second-to-last
        ramp index instead of the last, and then treat the last as turbo
      - or, this could be the default behavior?
          - always reserve last index of ramp config for turbo
  - make thermal regulation smoother
  - experiment with pulse frequency modulation
  - update manual to reflect any changes

[old]
  - add support for off-time capacitor or off-time sleep mode to distinguish
    between long and short presses
      - https://github.com/alexvanh/basic_off_time_driver/blob/master/README.md
      - the above reports that relying on SRAM decay is not a reliable
        long-term solution...
      - my current understanding is that the flipping of bits after power is
        disconnected is essentially due to noise, but I'm unsure why this
        property of the SRAM should change over time... more reading is
        required
